description: Use when the developer says 'create pr', 'create pull request', 'open a PR', 'PR this branch', or 'submit for review' — pushes the current feature branch to GitHub, builds a Conventional-Commits title and a clean PR body (Summary / Changes / Testing) with NO attribution footer, and opens the PR into `main` via `gh pr create` (or the GitHub MCP).

# Create PR — Push branch, open a GitHub PR into `main`

Open a GitHub pull request from the current feature branch into `main` on
`github.com/dxiiren/vbnet-winforms-labs`.

## Trigger

When the developer says any of:

- "create pr" / "create pull request" / "open a PR"
- "PR this branch" / "PR for this work"
- "submit for review"

---

## Preconditions (your job — verify before opening the PR)

1. **On a feature branch, not `main`** — `git branch --show-current`. If it prints
   `main`, STOP: "You're on `main`. Branch first (`git checkout -b feat/...`) before a PR."
2. **Clean tree** — `git status --porcelain`. If non-empty, STOP: "You have
   uncommitted changes. Run `/commit` first." Never open a PR over a dirty tree.
3. **Commits ahead of `main`** — `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` (fall back to
   local `main` if `origin/main` is stale). If there are zero commits ahead, STOP:
   "No commits ahead of `main` — nothing to PR."
4. **`gh` is authenticated** — `gh auth status`. If it fails, tell the developer to
   run `gh auth login` (or fall back to the GitHub MCP if configured).
5. **No open PR already for this head** — `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open`.
   If one exists, show it and ask: A) push new commits + let it update, or B) stop.

## Steps

### 1 — Push the branch

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Never force-push. If the upstream diverged, stop and let the developer reconcile.

### 2 — Build the PR title (Conventional Commits)

- If the branch has a **single** commit and its subject is already Conventional
  (`type(scope): summary`), reuse it verbatim as the title.
- If there are multiple commits, synthesize one Conventional title that summarizes
  the change, e.g. `feat(floormat): guard against no grade selected` or
  `docs(tooling): document the MSBuild warning baseline`. Pick the type/scope from the
  dominant change, not just the first commit.

### 3 — Write the PR body (clean, NO attribution footer)

Use this template. Keep it tight; fill from the actual diff/commits.

```markdown
## Summary

<1–3 sentences: what this PR does and why.>

## Changes

- <bullet per meaningful change — class/recipe/doc touched>
- <...>

## Testing

- <how it was verified: `just build-all` exit code, `just run {lab}` window alive ~5 s
  then `just stop`, manual click-through of the changed form, etc.>
```

**NEVER** append `Co-Authored-By`, "Generated with Claude Code", a session link,
or any Claude/Anthropic attribution to the title or body. The PR reads as the
owner's own work.

### 4 — Open the PR

Preferred — `gh` CLI (write the body to a temp file to preserve Markdown):

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --title "<conventional title>" \
  --body-file "<path-to-body.md>"
```

(Or use the GitHub MCP `create_pull_request` with the same base=`main`, head=branch,
title, body — whichever is available. Fall back silently between them.)

### 5 — Report back

Print the **PR URL and number**, the branch, base (`main`), commit count, and the
title used. This repo has no CI — verification is the `just build-all` / `just run {lab}`
evidence in the Testing section.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never** open a PR from `main` or with a dirty tree.
- **Never** open a PR with zero commits ahead of `main`.
- **Never** force-push to publish the branch.
- **Never** add an attribution / `Co-Authored-By` footer to the title or body.
- **Never** silently create a duplicate PR — check for an open one first and ask.
